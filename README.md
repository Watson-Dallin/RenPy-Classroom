# Overview

I made a brief demonstration game for a personal project I wanted to try.
I wanted to make a virtual lesson library for my children to learn about things.
I decided that the Python based visual novel engine Ren'Py was well suited to
make such a "game". I did this for my own children and plan to add many lessons
to out of love for them.

# Development Environment

I used the Ren'Py visual novel engine which is built on and incorporates Python.
Thus I wrote this program in Python and Ren'Py scripting language.
Atom is the text editor recommended by the official Ren'Py devs, so that is what
I used.

# Future Work

* More and more lessons for my children
* A lesson selection menu
* Get my wife to record voice narration and match that to the script as none of my kids can read yet.
